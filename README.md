Learning PyTorch for deep learning

### PyTorch course information

I am currently working through a Youtube PyTorch course to learn how to use PyTorch for deep learning. This course follows the instruction of Daniel Bourke and teaches all the fundamentals of what tensors are, how they work, how to create them, how to manipulate them, and of course using PyTorch for different neural network types.

I will be using this repository to track my progress throughout the course as I dive into my PyTorch journey!
